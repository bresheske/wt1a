  <p>We did not have any applicants for 2017.  Consider nominations for next year!</p>

  <h4>2016 Outstanding Service Award Recipient</h4>
  <p>On behalf of the Wisconsin Title I Association, please join us in congratulating <strong>Mrs. Cynthia Terrill</strong> on receiving the Outstanding Service Award for 2016.</p>
  <p>Cindy Terrill, current K-12 Reading Specialist and Title 1 teacher at Pecatonica Area Schools is completing her 39th year of teaching.  She has enjoyed a wide career  as an elementary teacher for 7 years at Mineral Point- her hometown, followed by 7 years as a principal at St. Joseph's Catholic School in Dodgeville, and then 7 years as the Reading Specialist for the Dodgeville School District.  In 1990, she received the WSRA Outstanding Administrator in Reading award.  She served as President and later on the board for the Hidden Valley Reading Council for numerous years.  During the past 18 years she has been Pecatonica's sole Title 1 teacher for their K-5 elementary.  In addition, Cindy has taught graduate classes in reading for UW-Platteville and UW-Oshkosh and numerous summer academies from around the state.  She has contemplated retirement since the birth of her 9 grandchildren but just can't let go yet as teaching still excites her today as much as it did in 1976 when she first started.  She is very proud that three of her children have also chosen to be teachers as well.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Terrill was nominated by the Superintendent of Pecatonica Area Schools, Dr. Jill Underly.   Dr. Underly spoke to Mrs. Terrill's active involvement and leadership in the district's Title I program and highlighted Cindy's leadership and significant impact on the growth of the district and her students.</p>
  <blockquote>
      Mrs. Terrill is a continuous learner who sets a wonderful example of this for both her students and her colleagues.  She is never afraid to try something new.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Congratulations Mrs. Cynthia Terrill!</p>
